Time was gone and our SEO/owner decided that horisontal busines scaling not so effective as we can be and we switched to own product - Pushwoosh. At first it was an a hight load platform for deliver push-notification, but later we adopted another platforms and changed our direction to marketing communications platform with more emphasis to statiscics & analytics.
